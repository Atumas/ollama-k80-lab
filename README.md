## Overview

This project explores running Ollama, a local LLM runner, with an NVIDIA K80 GPU. The goal is to assess performance, explore limitations, and demonstrate the potential of this combination for local LLM experimentation and deployment. We also investigate the usage of Dify for building LLM applications and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with VS Code's Continue plugin for filesystem operations.

## Motivation

* **Local LLM Exploration:** Ollama simplifies running Large Language Models locally. This project leverages Ollama's ease of use with the power of a GPU.
* **K80 Utilization:** The NVIDIA K80, while an older GPU, remains a viable option for LLM inference, particularly for smaller to medium-sized models.
* **Dify Integration:** Dify provides a robust framework for building LLM applications (chatbots, agents, etc.). We aim to demonstrate seamless integration between Ollama and Dify for rapid prototyping and deployment.
* **Cost-Effective Experimentation:** Running LLMs locally avoids the costs associated with cloud-based APIs, enabling broader access and experimentation.

## Modified Version

This repository includes a customized version of Ollama, specifically optimized for running on an NVIDIA K80 GPU. This build incorporates specific configurations to address potential compatibility issues with the K80 architecture. For more details, contributions, and the full build process, visit our GitHub page:
[ollama37](https://github.com/dogkeeper886/ollama37)

**Key Features of the Custom Build:**

*  **CUDA 11.4 Support:** The build is configured to work with CUDA Toolkit 11.4, which is a common and well-supported version for the K80.
*  **GCC 10 Compatibility:** We built GCC 10 from source to ensure compatibility with the Ollama build process.
*  **CMake Manual Compilation:** CMake was compiled manually to avoid potential issues with pre-built binaries.
*  **Go Installation:** The project includes instructions for installing Go, a key component of the Ollama build.

## Setup and Running

**Prerquisites:**

*  NVIDIA K80 GPU
*  CUDA Toolkit 11.4
*  GCC 10 (or later)
*  Go (version compatible with Ollama - check Ollama documentation)
*  CMake
*  Git

**Steps:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dogkeeper886/ollama37`
2. Follow the instructions in the `ollama37` repository for building and installing Ollama.
