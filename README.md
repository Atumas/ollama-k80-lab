## Overview

This project explores running Ollama, a local LLM runner, with a NVIDIA K80 GPU and investigates its integration with Dify, a powerful framework for building LLM-powered applications. The goal is to assess performance, explore limitations, and demonstrate the potential of this combination for local LLM experimentation and deployment.

## Motivation

* **Local LLM Exploration:** Ollama makes it incredibly easy to run Large Language Models locally. This project aims to leverage that ease with the power of a GPU.
* **K80 Utilization:** The NVIDIA K80, while older, remains a viable GPU for LLM inference. This project aims to demonstrate its capability for running smaller to medium sized LLMs.
* **Dify Integration:** Dify provides a robust framework for building LLM applications (chatbots, agents, etc.). We want to see how seamlessly Ollama and Dify can work together, allowing us to rapidly prototype and deploy LLM-powered solutions.
* **Cost-Effective Experimentation:** Running LLMs locally avoids the costs associated with cloud-based APIs, enabling broader access and experimentation.

## Modified Version

This repository includes a modified version of Ollama, specifically customized for running on a Tesla K80 GPU. For more details and contributions, visit our GitHub page:
