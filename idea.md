**Video Title:**
Run LLMs Directly in VS Code with Continue (Alternatives to Cline!)

**Video Structure & Script Ideas:**

*   **You:** "Hey everyone, I'm going to introduce 'Continue,' a VS Code plugin that solves a common problem with other popular solutions like Cline, and lets you run LLMs locally, directly within your coding environment."

*   **You:** "Lots of people are using plugins like Cline to bring LLMs into VS Code. It’s a great concept!  However, Cline has a significant issue: the context window.  Cline sends your prompts and code to a remote server, and the size of that context window – the amount of text the LLM can consider – can be *huge*. "

*   **You:** "This means running Cline often requires a powerful GPU. People with older gpu like me, find themselves forced to use smaller, less capable LLMs, like the 0.5B model, just to get it to work."

*   **You:** "That’s where 'Continue' comes in. 'Continue' tackles this problem head-on by using Ollama to run the LLM *locally* on your machine."
*   **You:** "This means you can leverage powerful LLMs without needing a cloud connection or a high-end GPU." (Emphasize the key benefit: local, powerful LLMs.)
*   **You:**  "Critically, Continue's interface lives *inside* VS Code.  No more switching back and forth between your editor and a browser window. It's a seamless, integrated experience."
*   **Briefly explain Ollama's role:**  "Ollama makes running LLMs locally incredibly easy.  You don't need to be an AI expert to get started."

**4. Demo (2:30 - 5:00):  Show, Don't Just Tell!**

*   **(Visual: Screen recording of you using "Continue" in VS Code.)**
*   **You (Narrating):**
    *   "Let's walk through a quick example.  I have this file open..." (Show the file in VS Code.)
    *   "To use Continue, I just right-click, and select 'Continue Chat'." (Show the context menu.)
    *   “You can type in a prompt, like 'Explain this code snippet' and press enter.” (Type a simple prompt and wait for the response.)
    *   **Show the response appearing directly within VS Code.**
    *   **Show how you can easily select a block of code and send it to the LLM for analysis or explanation.** "The real power here is the ability to easily select code and send it to the LLM."
    *   **Show how easy it is to experiment with different LLMs through Ollama.** (If time allows - demonstrates flexibility).
    *   **Keep it concise and focused on the core benefits (seamless integration, local LLMs).**

**5.  Wrap Up & Call to Action (5:00 - 5:30)**

*   **(Visual:  End screen with links and social media handles.)**
*   **You:** "So, if you're looking for a way to bring the power of LLMs into your VS Code workflow without the limitations of Cline, 'Continue' is definitely worth checking out.”
*   **You:** "I'm going to put a link to the plugin in the description below.  Go give it a try and let me know what you think in the comments!"
*   **Encourage engagement:** "If you found this video helpful, please like and subscribe for more developer tools and tutorials!"

**Production Tips:**

*   **Screen Recording Software:** OBS Studio (free), Camtasia (paid).
*   **Microphone:**  A decent USB microphone will significantly improve audio quality.
*   **Lighting:** Good lighting makes you look more professional.
*   **Edit!:** Cut out any unnecessary pauses or mistakes. Tight editing makes a big difference.
*   **Music:** Background music can add atmosphere, but keep it subtle and non-distracting.  Use royalty-free music.



**IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS (Read This!)**

*   **Target Audience:** This video is for developers who are already familiar with VS Code and potentially have some interest in using LLMs. Don’t assume *everyone* knows what an LLM is.
*   **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):**
    *   **Keywords:** "VS Code", "LLM", "AI", "Local LLM", "Continue", "Cline", "Ollama" - use these naturally throughout your video title, description, and tags.
    *   **Thumbnail:** Create a visually appealing thumbnail that clearly communicates the video's topic.  Include the "Continue" plugin icon and some text (e.g., "Local LLMs in VS Code").
    *   **Description:** Write a detailed description that includes keywords and a summary of the video's content.
*   **Engagement is Key:** Respond to comments and questions. Building a community around your channel is crucial for growth.
*   **Call to Action Placement:** Put the call to action (subscribe, like) in multiple places: at the beginning, middle, and end of the video.
*   **Monetization:**  Consider how you might monetize your channel (ads, sponsorships) once you have a decent amount of views.




To help me refine this further, can you tell me:

*   What level of developer are you targeting? (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced?)
*   Do you want to include a section on how to install Ollama? (It adds complexity, but might be helpful.)
*   Are there any specific features of "Continue" that you want to highlight?
