# Ollama CUDA 11.4 Builder Image for Tesla K80 (Compute Capability 3.7)

This Docker image provides a development environment tailored specifically to build [Ollama37](https://github.com/dogkeeper886/ollama37) on older NVIDIA GPUs, with an emphasis on devices like the **Tesla K80** which have compute capability of `3.7`. It comes equipped with essential tools and software including CUDA toolkit 11.4 support.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- **Base Image:** Rocky Linux v8
- **CUDA Toolkit Version:** 11.4 - For high-performance GPU acceleration.
- **NVIDIA Driver (v470):** `nvidia-driver:470-dkms` to ensure compatibility with Tesla K80 GPUs and beyond, specifically targeting compute capability of version 3.7.
- **GCC v10:** A versatile compiler that will be necessary for building C/C++ projects in this Docker image environment is compiled from source within the container itself; thus ensuring up-to-date features are available during builds.
- **CMake (v4.0.0):** This build system generator, also built directly into our custom Rocky Linux 8 image version v10 ensures a comprehensive and flexible C/C++ project building process that can be tailored to your needs within this environment; again compiled from source for the latest features right in your container.
- **Go (v1.24.2):** This lightweight programming language is essential when compiling Go projects, especially those utilizing cgo.

This Docker image strikes a balance between supporting legacy hardware such as Tesla K80 and meeting modern software build requirements like CUDA 11.4 for cutting-edge development needs including but not limited to Ollama37.


## ðŸš€ How To Use

Designed with builders in mind; this container is perfect when you're aiming to compile projects that leverage the power of NVIDIA GPUs, particularly those compatible with compute capability `3.7`.

### Quick Example Usage:

```bash
docker run --rm -it dogkeeper886/ollama37-builder bash
```

When you have access inside your newly instantiated Docker environment (`dogkeeper886/ollama37-builder`):

1. Navigate to the source directory:
    ```sh
    cd /usr/local/src \
        && git clone https://github.com/dogkeeper886/ollama37 \
        && cd ollama37 
    ```
2. Set up your build and compile it using CMake along with GCC (as our custom compiled version):
    ```bash
    CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++ cmake -B build \
        && cmake --build build
    ```
3. Lastly, go ahead and compile the project using Go (also utilizing our custom-built version), ensuring you have enabled modules for compatibility:
    ```bash
    go build -o ollama .
    ```
